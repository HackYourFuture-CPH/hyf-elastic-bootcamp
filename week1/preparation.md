 # Preparation

We will be using a small example application to look at some of the Elastic APM features.

Please have it installed and running before the workshop, by following the instructions in the [SETUP.md](https://github.com/simitt/apm-movie-demo-app/blob/main/SETUP.md) guide. 

Ensure that you can make http requests to a backend app (for example by using [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl) or [postman](https://www.postman.com/))
